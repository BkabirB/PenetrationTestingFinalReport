Ethical penetration testing: Implemented a repeatable and mature methodology tailored to unique assessments. Identified vulnerabilities of targets, scored their risk, and explained mitigations. Responsibly disclosed findings in a professional report that can be used to recreate the exploit, explained the impact to the target, and prioritized each finding. Enumerated target hosts, domains, exposures, and attack surfaces. Identified flaws and vulnerabilities in applications, websites, networks, systems, protocols, and configurations using both manual techniques and assistive tools. Reverse engineered compiled applications to discover exploitable weaknesses. Wrote new exploits to test various types of vulnerabilities on clients, against servers, and to escalate privileges.
